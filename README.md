# Maze-Solver

This is a program that will read in a maze as a text file and use different
machine learning techniques to solve it.  This is my first attempt at writing
an artificially intelligent software so any feedback would be much appreciated

## Usage instructions

To run the application, run the Driver.py file from your IDE.

As a program argument, you will need to include the text file you would like to use a maze.
There are numerous maze files already included for you
in the mazes directory.  You should provide the relative path to the
text file from the root directory.
