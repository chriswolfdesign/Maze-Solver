# Maze-Solver

This is a program that will read in a maze as a text file and use different
machine learning techniques to solve it.  This is my first attempt at writing
an artificially intelligent software so any feedback would be much appreciated

## Usage instructions

To run the application, use the following command from the root directory: \
`python src/ui/Driver.py <maze_text_file>` \
where <maze_text_file> is the text file you would like to use
as your maze.  There are numerous maze files already included for you
in the mazes directory.  You should provide the relative path to the
text file from the root directory.
